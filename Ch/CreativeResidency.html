<h1> What is My Goal and Inspiration? </h1> 

<p> I am an artist-turned-programmer, and learning to program felt like running naked through a room full of angry cats.  My goal is very simple: I never want any student of mine to feel as lost, stupid, and powerless as I did when I learned to code. Programming is an art, and art ought to inspire and empower, not confuse and demoralize.</p>

<p>When I first began, I did not understand it when my teacher said, "First, you put a value in a variable."  I had no idea what a value was. I had no idea what a variable was.  When I asked, the instructor looked at me like I was a total idiot.  It shocked him that I didn't understand something as "simple" as a variable.  </p>

<p> It was several years before I heard the analogy, "A variable is like a box."  I wish it hadn't been several years before I learned this.  I wish it had been the very first day.</p>

<p>So how will I make programming easier to learn?</p> 

<h1><a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/">I will make programming easier to learn by making a webcomic where cats use analogies teach you how to code.</a></h1>

<h1> What is My Approach? </h1>

<p>I have written the first 8 chapters of the webcomic <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/"> Cats Learn Code.</a>  While making it, I kept in mind that first impressions are crucial. Imagine walking into a store. A store that is dull, dingy and cramped will make an entirely different impression than a store that is bright, clean, and spacious. If my introductory tutorial is the first exposure someone has to programming, I intend to ace the first impression. I do that in three ways. </p>

<h3> First, <i> no setup time. Period. </i></h3> 

<p>  My first chapter gets you started typing code <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/1.html"> immediately</a>.  When I first learned to code, my instructor gave me a list of prep work to do, not knowing that the resources he gave would soon leave me wishing I was lucky enough to be eating raw liver.  I followed all of the instructions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/tararoys/c4aa39418529b5a043ca"> I documented my five-day descent into the madness of text-editor configuration.</a> That experience was awful.  I refuse to inflict it on any student of mine.</p>

<p> There is a better way.  It's called Javascript. Anyone with an internet-connected computer has the tools needed to learn it and run it <em>already installed</em> because <em> everyone connected to the internet already has a browser.</em>  My first tutorial shows people where that tool is. </p>

<p> I've given several people this tutorial, and by the end, they come away smiling and excited. That is how a first experience ought to be.</p>

<h3>Second, make it memorable. </h3>

<p>  Abstract ideas are hard to hold in your head because you can't see, feel, touch, taste, or interact with them.  The solution?  Make them concrete. </p> I borrowed this idea from scientists Chip Heath and Dan Heath, who researched <a href="http://www.engineerguy.com/white-papers/made-to-stick.htm"> how to make ideas memorable.</a>   HTML elements become boxes.  Functions become gumball machines.  Strings become beads on a string.  

<p>I intend to start a student from nothing and leave them able to build a website like Twitter.  I attended a coding bootcamp where we did precisely that in nine weeks.  During each day, I had to understand approximately 20 abstract concepts.  I turned them all into concrete analogies, and by the end of nine weeks I had 450 programming-related analogies. 

<h3>Third, people aren't afraid of comics.</h3>

<p>Comics are not very intimidating.  Most programming books look incredibly serious.  It's like looking at a newspaper: I'd much rather skip all of the serious news about the economy and go directly to the funnies.  People will read a comic when they can't bring themselves to read a book.</p>

<h4>  Also, cats are funny and make people smile.</h4>

<p> Cats are funny and cute.  Everything is better with cats. <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/2.html"> Including HTML. </a> </p>



<h2> What Tools and Technologies Will You Use?</h2>

<p>Among other things, I am a sketch artist.  When I sketch, people ask me what kind of pencil I use, as if the pencil is infused with some kind of magical power that makes me draw portraits really well.  It's not magic. It's just a pencil.  What's important is the skill. </p>

<p>The most important tool I will use is my skill at translating abstract concepts into analogies. The second most important ability will be to organize those analogies into a story. Everything else is window dressing.</p>

<p>My current set of window dressing does rely heavily on computers and software. I find it funny that right now I'm going to do precisely the thing I've been arguing against.  I'm going to indulge in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">curse of knowledge.</a> I, a web developer, am going to say a bunch of words and assume that you know what I'm talking about.  To make the comic, I use an iphone and an app called Strip Designer. To build the website that hosts the comic, I use a full stack of web-developer tools.   For local computer devlopment, I use Mac OSX as my operating system; Sublime and Vim as my code editors; git as my version control system; various command line utilites as formatters, tidiers, and string manipulators; echo as my ad-hoc note-taking system.  For servers and webhosting, I use Digital Ocean or Github as hosts, and use ruby, Rails, Jekyll, and github-pages as my swiss-army-knife for web development; Google Chrome's developer tools for testing; and a smattering of Node.js nonsense if I get bored.  For cloud tools that make life easier, I rely on Gist, Github, Dropbox, Kindle Direct Publishing, Vector Magic, Draft, and various chatrooms.  For general art and image manipulation, I use Photoshop, Gimp, inkscape or hardcoding customized tools using HTML Canvas or handwriting SVG paths in a browser.  I really can't explain those tools in the space of a paragraph. The webcomic I am pitching right now is going to take at least 1000 pages and 450 analogies to briefly explain all of them well enough that a person can be expected to use them.   </p>

<p>I honestly don't need any of these tools.  I could draw the whole thing with pencil and paper, borrow someone else's camera phone, and publish it on Tumblr.  Technology isn't the point. Empowering people to be able to use that technology is. </p>

<h2> Estimated Cost for Materials and Production </h2> 

<p><Excluding my salary, my estimated cost for materials, if I were to buy everything from scratch, is $9000.</p>  

<ul>
  <li>$1000 for a Macbook Air (used for creating and maintaining the webcomic Cats Teach Code)</li>
  <li> $500 for software, including Sublime, Alfred, Adobe tools, Dragon dictation, and assorted other tools.</li>  
  <li> $500 for cloud tools, including subscriptions to Draft, Dropbox, Github, Digital Ocean, Domain Name purchases, web tutorials, and hosting. </li>
  <li> $1000 for iphone + phone plan (Used for taking photos of cats and creating the comig using the app Strip Design)</li>
  <li> $5000 for cat food and cat medical care</li>
  <li> $1000 for taking various artists, developers, students, and other experts out to lunch so I can pick their brains. </li> </ul>

<p> I already have all of the tools I need except for the cat food, cat medical care, and lunch budgets,  so my actual budget is more like $6000. </p>
</ul>

<h1>How Will I Publicize this Project?</h1> 

<p> I intend to make this a webcomic.  Every time I complete a chapter, I will publish it.  Doing this regularly will build up a following. </p>
<p> I am connected with my old coding bootcamp and to the programming scene in Chicago. I know dozens of students who are feeling exactly the same pain I felt. I intend to market it specifically to them.  If they find it useful, they'll spread it to their friends. </p>
<p> Part of my job in this project is making sure this comic is actually understandable to a newbie.  As the expert and the writer of the book, I suffer from "the curse of the expert," so I am going to need newbies to test the book.  To that end, I intend to attend every introductory programming meetup I can find.  I intent to mentor and teach.  If my budget allows, I'm going to hire an apprentice and make it their job to try to teach themselves how to code.</p> 

<h1> What I hope to Accomplish as a Creative Resident </h1> 

<p> I assume it's obvious by now that I have a chip on my shoulder about the way programming is taught.  I want to make it better. I want artists to be able to learn to code.</p>

<p> By the end of the year, I intend to have 1000 pages of comic, featuring 450 analogies for the programming concepts you need to understand in order to build a website like Twitter.</p>
