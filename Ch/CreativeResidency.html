<h1> Goals, Inspiration, and Medium </h1> 

<p>  My goal is very simple: I never want any student of mine to go through what I had to go through to learn to program. </p>

<p>Any student can tell you that there is an ancient curse casting a twisted shadow across the land of computer programming.  That curse is called 'the curse of the expert.'  A student, shiny, enthusiastic, and new, will approach a master in the field, asking for bright pearls of knowledge.  The master will speak, and the student will retreat in confusion, because the master, secure in her knowledge and years of training, will have forgotten that the phrase, "Make it into a function" means precisely nothing to the eager young learner.  </p> 

<p> Programming is a lot like liver. I, who know how to cook, spice and season liver to make it delicious, love liver. To a person who does not have access to the training to cook liver themselves or to a skilled chef who is willing to make it delicious, liver is disgusting.  Even more worse are the experts who say to a newbie, "You want to learn to eat liver?  Then just eat liver!"  They do not realize that the newbie will attempt to eat it raw, munching down cold, slimy chuncks of iron-rich meat.  From the start, newbies will get the idea that eating liver is about pain and perserverance, about disgust and discomfort, and being left out in the cold by utterly unsympathetic elders who forget that 'soaking liver in milk for several hours and breading it and frying it makes it tolerable" is NOT common knowledge. Many newbies will leave, with nothing but an awful memory and distaste for everything to do with liver.</p>

<p> Learning to program left a bad taste in my mouth.  If you wish to know how bad, try eating liver raw. </p>  

<p>  Did you see what I just did?  I made an analogy.  I took an abstract concept, like "the curse of the expert" and made it into a [simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional story](http://www.engineerguy.com/white-papers/made-to-stick.htm). Could you literally taste the raw liver in the previous paragraph?  Did it toy with your emotions? Did it fill you with disgust?  Will you remember it? Can you feel why I care so passionately about this problem?</p>

<p> That gap, that hideous disconnect between the people who have the knowlege to make things better and can't explain it, and the students who want that knowedge but can't understand it, is my inspiration.  My goal is to bridge that gap.  I will do it with analogies.  I will do it by making no assumptions about what is 'common knowledge.'  Since I was born in the internet age, where memes rule supreme, I will do it with comics and I will do it with cats. </p>

<p> I have written the first 8 chapters of the webcomic Cats-Learn-Code <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/"> here.</a> </p> 

<h1> Approach </h1>

<p> Anyone walking into a store the first time can tell you that first impressions are crucial.  A store that is dull, dingy, and cramped, manned by unhappy people, will make an entirely different impression than a store that is open, brightly lit, and manned by confident people.  If my introductory tutorial is the first exposure someone has to programming, I intend to nail the first impression. I do that in three ways. </p>

<p> First, <i> no setup time. Period. </i> My first chapter gets you started typing code <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/1.html"> immediately</a>. Once upon a time, I innocently asked to learn how to program.  My instructor innocently gave me a list of prep work to do.  I innocently followed all of the instructions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/tararoys/c4aa39418529b5a043ca"> I documented my five-day descent into the madness of text-editor configuration.</a> That experience was awful, and I refuse to inflict it on any student of mine.</p>

<p> There is a better way. There is a language that has zero setup time because <i> it is already installed on every computer </i> It is the most popular language in the world.  It's called Javascript, and anyone with a computer has the tools needed to learn it and run it <i>already installed</i> because <i> everyone connected to the internet already has a browser.</i></p> 

<p> Second, I turn every programming term I use into a physical, concrete analogy.  HTML elements become boxes.  Functions become gumball machines.  Strings become beads on a string.  Abstract ideas are hard to hold in your head because you can't see, feel, touch, taste, or interact with them.  The solution?  Make them concrete. </p> 

<p>I intend to start a student from nothing and leave them able to build Twitter.  I attended a coding bootcamp where we did precisely that in nine weeks.  During each day, I had to understand approximately 20 abstract concepts that I needed to turn into concrete analogies in order for me to properly learn them.  20 concepts * 5 days * 9 weeks = approximately 450 analogies. </p>

<p>  The coding bootcamp that took me from zero to Twitter took 9 weeks.  In my experience, it takes at least 5 times longer to write good documentation than to read and use it. 5 times longer than 9 weeks is 45 weeks.  At a rate of 10 analogies per week, a year is a reasonable estimate of how long it will take to turn learning to program into a series of 450 concrete analogies.

<p> Third, cats.  Everything is better with cats. <a href=http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/2.html" Including HTML. </a> </p>



<h2> Tools and Technology</h2>

<h2> Estimated Cost for Materials and Production </h2> 

My estimated cost for materials, if I were to buy everything from scratch, is $4000.  
  - $1000 for a Macbook Air (used for creating and maintaining the webcomic Cats Teach Code)
  - $500 for software, including Sublime, Alfred, Adobe tools, Dragon dictation, and assorted other tools.  
  - $500 for cloud tools, including subscriptions to Draft, Dropbox, Github, Digital Ocean, Domain Name purchases, web tutorials, and hosting. 
  - $1000 for iphone + phone plan (Used for taking photos of cats and creating the comig using the app Strip Design)
  - $1000 for cat food and cat medical care
  - $1000 for taking various artists, developers, students, and other experts out to lunch so I can pick their brains.  

<p> I already have all of the tools I need except for the cat food, cat medical care, and lunch budgets,  so my actual budget is more like $2000. </p>

<h1>Publicity</h1> 

<p> I intend to make this a webcomic.  Every time I complete a chapter, I will publish it.  Doing this regularly will build up a following. </p>
<p> I am connected with my old coding bootcamp and to the programming scene in Chicago. I know dozens of students who are feeling exactly the same pain I felt. I intend to market it specifically to them.  If they find it useful, they'll spread it to their friends. </p>
<p> Part of my job in this project is doing quality assurance.  As the expert and the writer of the book, I suffer from "the curse of the expert," so I am going to need newbies to test the book.  To that end, I intend to find every introductory programming meetup I can find, and see if this works.  This also doubles as publicity. </p> 

<h1> What I hope to Accomplish as a Creative Resident </h1> 

<p> I assume it's obvious by now that I have a chip on my shoulder about the way programming is taught.  Programming is like liver.  It can be wonderful.  It can be healthy. It can give you strength and power.  With the right skill, the right chef, it can be the best thing ever.  It just needs to be prepared in a way that lets you appreciate it.</p>

<p> Because whether you've unwrapped a package of butcher paper and are staring at a bloody liver, or googled 'how to learn programming' and are staring at an incomprehensible unix man page...I <i>never</i> want you to think that you have to eat that shit raw. </p>
