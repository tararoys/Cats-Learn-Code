<h1> What is your goal and inspiration? </h1> 

<p> I am an artist-turned programmer, and learning to program was like eating raw liver. My goal is very simple: I never want any student of mine to go through what I had to go through to learn to program. </p>

<p>Any student can tell you that there is an ancient curse casting a twisted shadow across the computer programming profession.  That curse is called <a href"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_knowledge">the Curse of Knowledge."</a>  A student, afire with enthusiasm, will approach a master in the field, asking for bright pearls of knowledge.  The master will speak, and the student will retreat in confusion, because the master, secure in her knowledge and years of training, will have forgotten that the phrase "Make it into a function" means precisely nothing to the eager young learner.  </p> 

<p> Programming is a lot like liver.  I know how to marinate, season and spice liver so that it becomes delicious. Therefore I love liver. To a person who does not have my knowledge, liver is disgusting.  This disgust is made worse by experts who say "You want to learn to eat liver?  Then just eat liver!"  These experts do not realize that the newbie might attempt to eat it raw.  She might think that she is supposed to be munching down cold, slimy chuncks of iron-rich meat.  Newbies get the idea that eating liver is about pain and perserverance, about disgust and discomfort, and about being left out in the cold by utterly unsympathetic elders who forget that 'soaking liver in milk for several hours and breading it and frying it makes it tolerable" is NOT common knowledge. Many newbies will leave, with nothing but an awful memory and distaste for everything to do with liver.</p>

<p> Learning to program left a bad taste in my mouth.  If you wish to know how bad, try eating liver raw. </p>  

<p>  Did you see what I just did?  I made an analogy.  I took an abstract concept, "the curse of the expert," and made it into a <a href="http://www.engineerguy.com/white-papers/made-to-stick.htm">simple, unexpected, concrete, credible, emotional story </a>. Could you literally taste the raw liver in the previous paragraph?  Did it toy with your emotions? Did it fill you with disgust?  Will you remember it? Can you feel why I care so passionately about this problem?</p>

<p> That gap, that hideous disconnect between the people who have the knowlege to make things better and can't properly explain it, and the students who want that knowedge but can't understand it, is my inspiration.  My goal is to bridge that gap.  I will do it with analogies.  I will do it by making no assumptions about what is 'common knowledge.'  Since I was born in the internet age, where memes rule supreme, I will do it with comics and I will do it with cats. </p>

<p> I have written the first 8 chapters of the webcomic <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/"> Cats Learn Code.</a> </p>  Below is an excerpt from Chapter 1.

<h1> What is Your Approach? </h1>

<p> Anyone walking into a store the first time can tell you that first impressions are crucial.  A store that is dull, dingy, and cramped, manned by unhappy people, will make an entirely different impression than a store that is open, brightly lit, and manned by confident people.  If my introductory tutorial is the first exposure someone has to programming, I intend to nail the first impression. I do that in three ways. </p>

<p> First, <i> no setup time. Period. </i> My first chapter gets you started typing code <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/1.html"> immediately</a>. Once upon a time, I innocently asked how to learn how to program.  My instructor innocently gave me a list of prep work to do, not knowing that the resources he gave would be nearly useless to me.  I followed all of the instructions, and <a href="https://gist.github.com/tararoys/c4aa39418529b5a043ca"> I documented my five-day descent into the madness of text-editor configuration.</a> That experience was awful.  I refuse to inflict it on any student of mine.</p>

<p> There is a better way. There is a language that has zero setup time because <em> it is already installed on every computer </em> It is the most popular language in the world.  It's called Javascript, and anyone with a computer has the tools needed to learn it and run it <em>already installed</em> because <em> everyone connected to the internet already has a browser.</em>  My first tutorial merely shows people where that tool is. </p> 

<p> Second, I turn every programming term I use into a physical, concrete analogy.  HTML elements become boxes.  Functions become gumball machines.  Strings become beads on a string.  Abstract ideas are hard to hold in your head because you can't see, feel, touch, taste, or interact with them.  The solution?  Make them concrete. </p> 

<p>I intend to start a student from nothing and leave them able to build Twitter.  I attended a coding bootcamp where we did precisely that in nine weeks.  During each day, I had to understand approximately 20 abstract concepts.  I turned them into concrete analogies.  20 concepts * 5 days * 9 weeks = approximately 450 analogies. </p>

<p>  The coding bootcamp that took me from zero to Twitter took 9 weeks.  I am a technical writer. In my experience, it takes at least 5 times longer to write good documentation than to read and use it. 5 times longer than 9 weeks is 45 weeks. 45 weeks is about a year. At a rate of 10 analogies per week, a year is a reasonable estimate of how long it will take me to translate what I learned into an entertaining comic contaning 450 concrete analogies for programming concepts. 

<p> Third, cats.  Everything is better with cats. <a href="http://tararoys.github.io/Cats-Learn-Code/Ch/2.html"> Including HTML. </a> </p>


<h2> What Tools and Technologies Will You Use?</h2>

<p>Among other things, I am a sketch artist.  When I sketch, people ask me what kind of pencil I use, as if the pencil is infused with some kind of magical power that makes me draw portraits really well.  It's not magic. It's just a pencil.  What's important is the skill. </p>

<p>The most important tool I will use is my skill at translating abstract concepts into analogies. The second most important ability will be to organize those analogies into a story. Everything else is window dressing.</p>

<p>My current set of window dressing does rely heavily on computes and software. I find it funny that right now I'm going to do precisely the thing I've been arguing against.  I'm going to indulge in the curse of knowledge. I, a web developer, am going to say a bunch of words and assume that you know what I'm talking about.  To make the comic, I use an iphone and an app called Strip Designer.  To build the website that hosts the comic, I use a full stack of web-developer tools.  From top to bottom, they are: for local computer devlopment: Mac OSX as my operating system; Sublime and Vim as my code editors; git as my version control system; various command line utilites as formatters, tidiers, and string manipulators; echo as my ad-hoc note-taking system; ruby, Rails, Jekyll, and github-pages as my swiss-army-knife for web development; Google Chrome's developer tools for testing; and a smattering of Node.js nonsense if I get bored.  For cloud tools that make life easier, I rely on Gist, Github, Dropbox, Kindle Direct Publishing, Vector Magic, Draft, and various chatrooms.  For general art and image manipulation, I use Photoshop, Gimp, inkscape or hardcoding customized tools using HTML Canvas or handwriting SVG paths in a browser.  I really can't explain those tools in the space of a paragraph. The webcomic I am pitching right now is going to take at least 1000 pages to briefly introduce them well enough that a person can be expected to use them.   </p>

<p>I honestly don't need any of these tools.  I could draw the whole thing with pencil and paper, and publish it on Tumblr.  Technology isn't the point. Empowering people to be able to use that technology is. </p>

<h1>Publicity</h1> 

<p> I intend to make this a webcomic.  Every time I complete a chapter, I will publish it.  Doing this regularly will build up a following. </p>
<p> I am connected with my old coding bootcamp and to the programming scene in Chicago. I know dozens of students who are feeling exactly the same pain I felt. I intend to market it specifically to them.  If they find it useful, they'll spread it to their friends. </p>
<p> Part of my job in this project is doing making sure this comic is actually understandable to a newbie.  As the expert and the writer of the book, I suffer from "the curse of the expert," so I am going to need newbies to test the book.  To that end, I intend to attend every introductory programming meetup I can find.  I intent to mentor and teach.  If my budget allows, I'm going to hire an apprentice and make it their job to stress-test it.  </p> 

<h1> What I hope to Accomplish as a Creative Resident </h1> 

<p> I assume it's obvious by now that I have a chip on my shoulder about the way programming is taught.  Programming is like liver.  It can be wonderful.  It can be healthy. It can give you strength and power.  With the right skill, the right chef, it can be the best thing ever.  It just needs to be prepared in a way that lets you appreciate it.</p>

<p> Because whether you've unwrapped a package of butcher paper and are staring at a bloody liver, or googled 'how to learn programming' and are staring at an incomprehensible unix man page...I <i>never</i> want you to think that you have to eat that shit raw. </p>
